It'll be a deploy platform(or an DevOp platform) using:
1. Django as web server (controller) to manage the tasks
2. Ansible(or fabric) as local/remote executer (agent)
3. ZeroRPC(or Celery / rest api) to distribute tasks
4. Bootstrap and Vue to reduce the costs in front-end developing
-----------------------------

#required package:
1. django 1.11.X
2. django-rest-framework-2.X.X
3. other modules

#INSTALL GUIDE:
1. git clone xxxx
2. cd to project dir, using "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required package
3. using "python manage.py syncdb" to create your own database.
4. run test server or deploy the server in apache/nginx. Dokcer env is recommended

-----------------------------
#dev roadmap:
1. command management: keep sh command in database
2. agent register: agent will register to server
3. advanced user management.
4. agent remote control: push commands from server and execute them remotely.
5. agent status monitoring and graphic demonstration: monitor the agent status.
....and so on

-----------------------------
